# Geany_Config
customized geany configuration,  for python and documentation files

These are customized files in my ~/.config/geany directory,  for:

    development of python code
        using a dark theme
       
    writing of corresponding documentation (*.txt, *.hlp, *.gny files)
        with folding based on indentation
       
    using git as backup manager
        with working space on a USB SSD and the remote repo in local hard disk.
