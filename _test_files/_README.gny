Color highlighting of code and documentation,  makes them easier to read and understand:

Following assumes using a customized Geany,  as described in:
    ""

For example,  open following in geany to see color highlight results for different file extensions ....

     "color_test.gny"

     "color_test.py"

     "color_test.txt"

     "color_test.sh"

     "color_test.README"

Note: the '*.gny' file type is a custom extension for python related text documents,
configured to have color highlighting very similar to '*.py' code highlighting


Highlighting also helps to identify/open file and URL links,  try following:

    Right mouse button click on following,  then click 'Open Selected File'
        "../geany.conf"

    Right mouse button click on following,  then click 'Open URI'
        "www.geany.org"
